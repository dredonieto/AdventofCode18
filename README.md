# AdventofCode18
A collection of solutions to this year's challenges

## How to participate

Every day we create a new branch like `<username>-day-x` and we solve the problem there. When we are ready and happy with our solution we create a PR to `master` and we wait for reviews. It is important to also give your review to your mates :warning: **but not before finishing your solution** :warning:

Before starting you should create a folder with your project. It is advisable to create a package/folder for every day so you can keep your solutions separated and clean.

This challenge is also a good oportunity for practicing TDD. You can write some basic tests with the examples they provide each day and start solving the problem from there.

You can see an example of this matters with my project (a folder named `cotel`).
