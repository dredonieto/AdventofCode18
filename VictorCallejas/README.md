# AdventOfCode2018
ACM UPV Competition - 2018

The purpose is functional code, not clean code. Far away there are faster and cleaner algorithms but the purpose is to make code in the shortest amount of time.

Each folder contains: 
* The __two solutions__ of the problem
* Puzzle __input__
* In some cases __test__, that are the input of the examples

If you want to test the code make sure to have:
```sh
#include "cabezeras.h"
```
In the file `cabezeras.h` are all the libraries needed from the standard template library.
